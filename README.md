# Taaby_Cat_Data_Entry
This piece of code would help to input data in Tabby Cat easily with the help of a CSV file.

To run the file, change the appropriate {name of the tournament}, {site of the tournament}, {other slurs}, {name of your CSV file}. With that, you can now the program, put the API code, and then properly sorted data from the CSV would directly be imported one by one on the site in a short time, saving your man work and power. Once it's done completely, give it a look to check if the imported data is correct, machines can't always get it right without our supervision.

This code is written with the help of some references, specially designed for this purpose.
